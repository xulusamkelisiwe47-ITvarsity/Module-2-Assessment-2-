                  <h3>ARMANI</h3>

                  <P>Giorgio Armani S.p.A. (pronounced [ˈdʒordʒo arˈmaːni]), commonly known as Armani,
                    is an Italian luxury fashion house founded by Giorgio Armani which designs,
                    manufactures, distributes and retails haute couture, ready-to-wear,
                    leather goods, shoes, watches, jewelry, accessories, eyewear, cosmetics and home interiors.
                    The brand markets these products under several labels:[2] Giorgio Armani Privé, Giorgio Armani,
                    Armani Collezioni, Emporio Armani (including EA7), Armani Jeans, Armani Junior, and Armani Exchange.
                    The brand utilizes the association of the Armani name with high-fashion, benefiting from its prestige
                    in the fashion industry. In 2016, estimated sales of the company were around $2.65 billion.[3] In 2017,
                    Giorgio Armani announced that his company will close two of its fashion labels,
                    Armani Collezioni and Armani Jeans, as part of the restructuring process for his company.
                    While Armani Collezioni will merge back into the "Giorgio Armani" line, Armani Jeans will be mixed
                    with the Emporio Armani line due to their similarities in styles and the use of the same brand logo.</P>
