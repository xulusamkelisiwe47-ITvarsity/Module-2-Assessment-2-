                  <h3>SAMSUNG</h3>

                  <p>Samsung, South Korean company that is one of the world’s largest producers of electronic devices.
                     Samsung specializes in the production of a wide variety of consumer and industry electronics,
                     including appliances, digital media devices, semiconductors, memory chips, and integrated systems.
                     It has become one of the most-recognizable names in technology and produces about a fifth of South Korea’s
                     total exports.Samsung was founded as a grocery trading store on March 1, 1938, by Lee Byung-Chull.
                     He started his business in Taegu, Korea, trading noodles and other goods produced in and around the 
                     and exporting them to China and its provinces. After the Korean War, Lee expanded his business into
                     textiles and opened the largest woolen mill in Korea. He focused heavily on industrialization with
                     the goal of helping his country redevelop itself after the war. During that period his business
                     benefited from the new protectionist policies adopted by the Korean government, whose aim was to help
                     large domestic conglomerates (chaebol) by shielding them from competition and providing them easy financing.</p>
