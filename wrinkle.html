                  <h3>A WRINKLE IN TIME</h3>

                  <p> Summary
                     A Wrinkle in Time is the story of Meg Murry, a high-school-aged girl who is transported on an adventure 
                     through time and space with her younger brother Charles Wallace and her friend Calvin O'Keefe to rescue her
                     father, a gifted scientist, from the evil forces that hold him prisoner on another planet. 
                     At the beginning of the book, Meg is a homely, awkward, but loving girl, troubled by personal
                     insecurities and her concern for her father, who has been missing for over a year. The plot begins with
                     the arrival of Mrs. Whatsit at the Murry house on a dark and stormy evening.
                     Although she looks like an eccentric tramp, she is actually a celestial creature with the ability to
                     read Meg's thoughts. She startles Meg's mother by reassuring her of the existence
                     of a tesseract--a sort of "wrinkle" in space and time. It is through this wrinkle that Meg and her
                     companions will travel through the fifth dimension in search of Mr. Murry.</p>
