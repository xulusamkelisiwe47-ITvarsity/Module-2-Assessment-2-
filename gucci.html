                  <h3>GUCCI</h3>

                  <p>Gucci is an Italian fashion label founded in 1921 by Guccio Gucci,
                    making it one of the oldest Italian fashion brands in operation today.
                    Like many historic fashion houses, the brand started out as a luggage manufacturer,
                    producing luxury travel goods for Italy’s wealthy upper-classes, as well as equestrian equipment. 
                    Initially the brand produced primarily leather goods, as well as premium knitwear, silk goods,
                    shoes and handbags. During the second world war, material constraints owing to the war effort
                    forced the label to use cotton to create their goods. It was during this time that the label
                    introduced its distinctive “Double-G” monogram, as well as the now iconic Gucci stripe, consisting
                    of two green stripes interrupted by a single red bar.</p>
